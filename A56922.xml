            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <p>I know thou art liberal enough of thy Canting Rhetorick of Railing, and you do well, very well, to make use of it to others: But, <hi>William!</hi> we are more your Friends then you are aware of; we have a kindness for you, hold the same Opinions for the most part, and indeed are your very Fathers, and the Tutors that first taught you your Principles.</p>

               <speaker>Jes.</speaker>
               <p>You may say, or think what you list; But if I do not evince it to be a real Truth, let me never come to be Provincial of our Order, but be Indicted at the <hi>Old Bailey,</hi> and hang'd at <hi>Tyburn,</hi> as an unparrallel'd Example of <hi>Jesuitical</hi> Ill-lucke: And first of all, pray tell me seriously, what think you of the Scripture?</p>

               <p>Excellent right! Now we begin to come within Ken of one another; For this upon the whole matter, and at bottom plainly amounts to as much as our Resolving, all Power into the <hi>Pope,</hi> and a Councel: For we suppose as well as you, the Light, that is, the Spirit of God to be present with our <hi>Pope,</hi> and his Councel; and that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37716:3"/> thereby He, and they, have Power Infallibly to resolve all Religious Controverses: Wherefore, since with you each particular <hi>Quaker,</hi> is to submit to the Light of the Body, though his, or her, particular Light, dictate otherwise I see not a hairs breadth difference between our Implicite Faith and yours; But conceive it altogether as reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to say, I believe so, or so, because the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve so; As because <hi>G.

               <p>Thou reasonest absurdly in the Spirit of Flesh, and confound'st thy self in the Eternal Abysse of Creaturely Darkness; for besides this particular, thy Church is an Idolatress, worships Images, uses Crosses, says Prayers in a Language People do not understand, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Come, come, the business here too, will prove as broad, as long between us: for if she set up Material external Images: you set up an Idaea, or an Internal Image to Idolise, and attribute Divine Honour to a Created natural Light: If she useth Crosses, you use more Crossness, and no less Superstition, in placing Religion in little Garbs, and sullen Phrases, &amp;c. But as for praying in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Tongue, I wonder you should be offended, since not long ago, when one of your Friends, a <hi>Dutch</hi> VVoman, that could speak no <hi>English,</hi> came over, you admitted her to speak publiquely amongst you; and declared, though none of you understood what she said, that yet you received great refreshing by it. Our Prayers are directed to a Power that understands not only all Languages, but the desires of each individual Heart, before they are formed into words: but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Clatter of a Paper-mill, or a fit of Musique on the Gridiron, and Tongs might have been; if your Friends had thought fit so to fancy, altogether as Edifying, and refreshing, as this silly Fro's Canting, in <hi>Hogan Mogan Gibber sh.</hi>

               <speaker>Jes.</speaker>
               <p>I will dispatch as compendiously as I can: 'Tis to well known what endeavours we have used, eve since the Reformation, to Re-establish our Religion in <hi>England;</hi> To this end we found it necessary to unsettle all things in Church, and Estate, and therefore having by our Intrigues, and Agents, involved three Nations in Confusion, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of those unnatural Wars: when Religion was all the talk, and every man new modelling it according to his fancy, you may think we were as busie as any, but knowing if we should appear in our true Colour, and plead for down-right Popery, we should be universally hated or contemn'd; we therefore assuming the habit of Laymen, and professing several Mechanick Trades, which we had learn'd for the purpose, we subtilely insinuated into the Army, and in several Parts of the Nation (especially in the <hi>North,</hi> as not will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to come at first too near <hi>London,</hi> lest any that had known us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Sea, should discover us.) Here we took up several Forms of Religion, and run through the various Professions then in Fashion, but still pretending to a stricter Holiness, and more refined Notions; we at last began to Breath the wonderful Knack of <hi>Quakerisme,</hi> Composed in some measure of the thriving subtilities of our own So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and the nasty Austerities of other Orders, bottomed upon contempt of the Scripture, before mentioned; As the best prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Blew to lay a true <hi>Roman</hi> Scarlet upon, when we should think fit; withal Blended with several odd Crochets, and Heresies, so long since exploded, that they now seemed fresh Discoveries, and Virgin Beams of this new Light; And that it might be taken notice of, and reverenced by Credulous well-meaned People, we ordered it to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, in the greatest shew of Meekness, Innocency, and honesty, an affected plainess in Apparel, and resolute humour of denying Civil respects.</p>
               <p>To which we added at first a Phrensical Practice of Raving, which served like <hi>Mahomets</hi> falling Sickness, to stamp the business with a pretence of Inspiration: A few unintelligible Notions of <hi>Jacob Behmen,</hi> and insignificant expressions of some Melancholly Doctors of our own; about Abstractedness of Life, Mental Prayer, and silent wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37716:4"/> for pure Actuations in the depth of the Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Together with endless Repitions, of minding the Light, served excellently for the furnishing the first spreaders of it with long Harangues, that were therefore admired because they were impossible to be understood.</p>
               <p>The Design being thus laid, and <hi>Quakerisme</hi> sown in the <hi>North,</hi> It began to spread gallantly; though it was like to have miscarried in Swadling Clouts, by the too open Imprudence of <hi>Nailor:</hi> but that Sore was soon Salv'd, and ever since it has thriven amain, to our great Comfort: Who have always in our thoughts, reckon'd those of your Party, our own. Well knowing, that if we can but once unsettle Peoples Faith from a Relyance on the Scriptures, and engage them in such truly Athistical Opinions, our business was half done. For then we can as soon as we see a fit opportunity, tell them that the Light they have acknowledged, must be the Sole Rule. Is not any particular but a general Light: which is nothing else but the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Tradition of the Church; witnessed unto by good Ancient Friends in all Ages that have been found in the Faith. And this Light being thus Infallible whatever it proposes, All must acquiesce there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: And so a Door is opened to let in Popery in gross, and then your Formalities will easily vanish, being almost worn off already; and you will be in all points fit to be received into the bosome of our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church; and to be publickly owned for her Children.</p>

               <p>Plainly, if the <hi>Pope</hi> believes as thou say'st; I do not see but he has great manifestation of the Light. And though I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all thou hast laid down, yet there may be something in the thing; and perhaps our Friends, <hi>Parrot</hi> and <hi>Fisher,</hi> went to <hi>Rome,</hi> not so much to Convert the <hi>Pope,</hi> as to fetch Instructions: However, tis not convenient to let any thing of it be known abroad.</p>

               <p>Ee'n bear it out with Huffing; affirming or denying any thing as may make most for your Repute: never stand upon <hi>Yea,</hi> and <hi>Nay,</hi> when your Honour is at Stake, but be sure do it with the highest Confidence, though never so untrue, some body or other will be so good natur'd, as to believe you. He that tells a Lye faintly, bespeaks himself to be suspected. At the same time vilifie your Adversaries, fling Dirt enough, some will stick; Let your words be like the Devils Oracles, capable of two or three Senses: The Art of Equivocation is absolutely necessary at a pinch, and a neat way of Legerdemain no less useful, to pervert an Authors words, and make him speak what you list; and then fall upon him like Lightning for the Absurdity.</p>
